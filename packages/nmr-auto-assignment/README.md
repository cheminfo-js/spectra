# nmr-auto-assignment

Pure JavaScript NMR automatic assignment. Detail of the algorithm are described in the paper: 
[Fully automatic assignment of small molecules' NMR spectra without relying on chemical shift predictions]
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrc.4272/abstract)

This program can use as input the list of peaks given by the automatic peak picking routines from the spectra-data project: [spectra-data](https://github.com/cheminfo-js/spectra-data)
